# roundtripping. Without this serializer, some queue adapters may serialize
# `BigDecimal` arguments as simple (non-roundtrippable) strings.
#
# When deploying an application with multiple replicas, old (pre-Rails 7.1)
# replicas will not be able to deserialize `BigDecimal` arguments from this

###
# Specify the default serializer used by `MessageEncryptor` and `MessageVerifier`
# instances.
#
# The legacy default is `:marshal`, which is a potential vector for
# deserialization attacks in cases where a message signing secret has been
# leaked.
#
# In Rails 7.1, the new default is `:json_allow_marshal` which serializes and
# deserializes with `ActiveSupport::JSON`, but can fall back to deserializing
# with `Marshal` so that legacy messages can still be read.
#
# In Rails 7.2, the default will become `:json` which serializes and
# deserializes with `ActiveSupport::JSON` only.
#
# Alternatively, you can choose `:message_pack` or `:message_pack_allow_marshal`,
# which serialize with `ActiveSupport::MessagePack`. `ActiveSupport::MessagePack`
# can roundtrip some Ruby types that are not supported by JSON, and may provide
# improved performance, but it requires the `msgpack` gem.

# together. This changes the message format, so messages serialized this way
# cannot be read by older versions of Rails. However, messages that use the old
# format can still be read, regardless of whether this optimization is enabled.
#
# To perform a rolling deploy of a Rails 7.1 upgrade, wherein servers that have
# not yet been upgraded must be able to read messages from upgraded servers,
# leave this optimization off on the first deploy, then enable it on a
